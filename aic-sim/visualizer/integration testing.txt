Continuous integration:
  Does the visualizer recover from a failed attempt to load an image?
   - offline.html, move image, load, restore image, load
   - once with canvas and applet version
  Do all major browsers load both versions?
   - Chrom(e/ium), Firefox, IE, Opera, Safari
  Do all ways to load a replay work?
   - direct, PHP, XmlHttpRequest
  Do the buttons and keys work as expected?

Test once:
  Does the applet version start automatically IE 8 and older?
